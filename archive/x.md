# X Accounts Being Archived

The archiving of Twitter accounts occurs when these accounts are inactive, yet still contain valuable information. In such cases, we transition these accounts to private status and delete all data. This allows us to potentially reactivate these accounts in the future.

## Accounts Scheduled for Reactivation in 2024
* [@STNETRadioPod - STNET Radio Podcast](https://twitter.com/STNETRadioPod)

## Accounts Currently Archived
* [@STNETRadioVideos - STNET Radio Videos](https://twitter.com/STNETRaadioVideod)
* [@SNTNETRShop - STNET Radio Shop](https://twitter.com/STNETRShop)
