# Introduced STNET Radio RSS

Hello, This is STNET Radio Podcast.

We are thrilled to see the growing interest from listeners worldwide! Our podcast has been distributed to **over 20 platforms**, with more than **1,000 plays**. To enhance the audio quality of our podcasts, we are excited to introduce **STNET Radio RSS**.

## **About STNET Radio RSS**  

Recently, we tested **self-hosted podcasting** via **rss.stnetradio.com** with some of our podcasts. The results showed smoother playback and significantly improved audio quality.  

### **Why We Started STNET Radio RSS**  
Currently, we rely on third-party podcast hosting services, which have several limitations, such as:  
- Audio file encoding restrictions  
- File size limitations  
- Increasing costs  

**STNET Radio RSS** was developed to address these issues, allowing our creators to upload high-quality audio files for their listeners seamlessly.

## **Highlights of STNET Radio RSS**  
- Supports larger file sizes for better audio quality  
- Enables advanced features like **Apple Podcasts Chapters**  
- Provides an enhanced listening experience for all audiences  

### **Supported File Types**  
1. **Pulse-Code Modulation (.wav)**  
2. **Free Lossless Audio Codec (.flac)**  
3. **MPEG-3 (.mp3)**  
4. **MPEG-4 Audio (.mp4a)**  

Youâ€™ll soon be able to upload files via **[creators.stnetradio.com](https://creators.stnetradio.com)** (Detailed information is available in the **STNET Radio Document**, requiring an **@stnetradio.com** email for access).  

---

## **Recommended Listening Platforms**  
For the best audio experience, we recommend listening on:  
- **Apple Podcasts**  
- **Tidal**  
- **Spotify Premium**  

---

## **For General Listeners**  
Soon, our podcasts will be even easier to access via **RSS Feed**, allowing you to stay updated and enjoy high-quality content through our website **[rss.stnetradio.com](https://rss.stnetradio.com)**.
